         reads an initial request paragraph, checking to see if it corresponds
         to an HTTP GET or POST.  For GET paragraphs, the function creates a
         complete new `kd_request' structure immediately.  For POST
         requests, the function also reads the entity body to recover the
         query string, if any.
         [//]
         The function does not block the caller; if insufficient data is
         available to completely parse the request, it returns false, but may
         be called again any number of times until the operation has been
         completed.  As with `kdcs_tcp_channel::read_paragraph' (which it uses)
         error conditions (e.g. failure of the TCP channel) will result in
         an exception being thrown, of type `kdu_exception'.
         [//]
         Upon success (i.e., whenever the function returns true), a
         new `kd_request' entry is always created and appended to the queue.
         If the request did not correspond to a recognized HTTP request,
         the request's `resource' string is set to NULL and all members of
         the `fields' structure will be NULL.  Otherwise, `resource' points
         to the original resource string (hex-hex decoded, if necessary) and
         the members of the `fields' structure are each set either to NULL
         (if the request field was not found) or to point to a pre-parsed
         null-terminated string, which has been hex-hex decoded if necessary.
         [//]
         Note that the `kd_request_fields.type' member may be derived
         either from an HTTP "Accept:" header line, or from a JPIP "type="
         request field in the query string.  The `kd_request_fields.target'
         member may be derived either from the resource string (after
         skipping over protocol prefixes) or from a JPIP "target=" request
         field in the query string.
         [//]
         If the request suggests that the TCP connection should be closed
         after the response is complete, the `kd_request::close_connection'
         member is set to true.  This is done if the request contained
         a "Connection: close" header or an HTTP version less than HTTP/1.1.
         [//]
         Exceptions thrown while trying to read the channel are not
         caught inside this function; the caller should generally catch
         them and close the channel.

           blocking call to fail.  In fact, timeouts do not prevent the object
           from continuing to transmit data on its internal holding queue.
           They are used only to unblock potentially blocking calls.
           [//]
           The present object only provides three blocking calls:
           [>>] `close' may need to block the caller until the internal holding
                queue has been emptied.
           [>>] `get_suggested_bytes' may block the caller until the holding
                queue is sufficiently empty to avoid excessive channel delays.
           [>>] `retrieve_requests' may block the caller until new requests
                are received.

         The function returns 0 if the holding queue is deemed to be too
         full, so that pushing additional data via `push_chunks' or

         (our objective is to keep the communication channel responsive).

         sufficiently empty for a non-zero return or a timeout occurs).

         [//]
         If this is an HTTP channel (i.e., `set_auxiliary' has been called),
         the `kds_chunk::prefix_bytes' portion of each chunk is discarded and
         the chunk byte counts are adjusted accordingly, but `content_type'
         should identify the MIME media type, or any valid string which
         may appear within an HTTP content-type header.
         [//]
         This function can safely be called at any time, regardless of whether
         the channel has been closed or a timeout has occurred.  It always
         succeeds, regardless of whether the return value is NULL or not.
         A non-NULL return value is used to return chunks which the caller
         must recycle immediately -- which may include those chunks just
         pushed in.  The caller should also use `retrieve_completed_chunks'
         to retrieve chunks which later become available for recycling.
         [//]
         For HTTP channels, the function always returns the list of chunks
         which are pushed in, copying them internally; this alows the channel
         to be passed around from session to session without blocking on the
         transmission of existing data.  Even for auxiliary TCP channels, the
         caller must be prepared to recycle chunks immediately in case the
         function returns non-NULL; it may do this if the channel has
         already closed down for some reason.
         [//]
         The `finished_using_channel' argument is meaningful only with
         auxiliary channels.  If true, it means that there will be no more
         chunks pushed into the channel, so the internal machinery should
         stop looking for acknowledgement messages once all chunks have
         been transmitted and acknowledged.  Otherwise, the internal
         machinery still checks for acknowledgements which might be
         sent by the client as a means of verifying that the client
         is using the channel correctly.  This funcionality is not really
         necessary, since if the channel dies while looking for an
         acknowledgement message, it will be shut down.  However, the
         additional information provided by this argument helps in debugging.

         In this case, you should invoke this function once you know that the
         chunks most recently pushed into `push_chunks' constitute a complete
         response to the relevant request and that no further chunks
         will be pushed in until after a new reply has been pushed via

         The function terminates the chunked transfer encoding associated
         with the current response.  If the existing collection of chunks
         do not already contain a JPIP EOR (End-Of-Response) message, you
         can force the current function to synthesize one by specifying a

         chunk list might contain an EOR message when supplied to
         `push_chunks'. For all other cases, including requests which
         are pre-empted so that no chunk list is ever generated, the
         present function may be used to queue the transmission of an
         isolated data chunk containing a single EOR message with the
         `eor_code' reason code.  Calling this function with `eor_code'=0

         go-ahead from this function, unless the call to `push_chunks'
         returned a non-NULL list of chunks which must be recycled
         immediately (as explained with `push_chunks', the caller of that

         Applications need only call this function once to retrieve all

         a call to `push_chunks' so as to minimize needless storage.

         In practice, you will never need to call this function with an

         the function, regardless of whether the channel is an auxiliary TCP
         channel or an HTTP channel, and this probably provides the best
         protection against internal implementation changes.  In fact, it is
         safe to call the function at any time, regardless of whether the

         until it can be transmitted.

         The `body_bytes' argument can take three different types of values
         as follows:

              terminate with a blank line, where each line terminates with
              a CRLF pair.
         [>>] If positive, the message `block' contains an HTTP reply
              paragraph that is followed by `body_bytes' of body data.
              The reply paragraph itself should terminate with a blank line.
              The body data appears within the message `block' as well, so
              the entire thing can be transmitted as a single entity.  The
              initial reply paragraph portion in `block' should contain all
              relevant Content-Length, Transfer-encoding and Content-Type
              headers for a legitimate HTTP response.  Either chunked or
              contiguous transfer encodings may be used so long as all
              headers are data appear within `block'.  The reason for
              supplying the `body_bytes' value in this case is only to help
              logging services record only the reply text, skipping the
              body data.
         [>>] If negative, the implementation associates the reply text
              supplied here with the data chunks pushed in via `push_chunks'.
              In this case, the reply text will not be delivered until
              the next data chunk is pushed in via `push_chunks'.  At that
              time, the implementation automatically adds the relevant
              Content-Type and Transfer-encoding HTTP headers, so they
              should not appear in the reply text passed in via the
              `block' argument.  In this case, as with both cases discussed

              line.

         already, there is no hope of ever delivery anything, so reply
         text is immediately discarded.  You can use the `is_active'
         function to determine whether or not the channel has been closed.

             `reply_bytes' is equal to the number of bytes from `reply'
           which have still to be transmitted.
             `num_eor_chunks' is the number of times the 11-byte `eor_chunk'
           should be sent before `chunk' data can be sent.  This is applicable
           only for auxiliary channels.
             `started_bytes' is 0 before anything is transmitted for this
           element.  Once transmission starts, `started_bytes' is set to
           the number of bytes we need to transmit.  It may be increased if
           we discover the need to send more data. Once all transmission is
           complete, `started_bytes' holds the number of bytes we have
           transmitted.
           [//]
           The quantities `interval_start_time' and `interval_bytes' are used
           to estimate network transmission rate R.  For HTTP-only transports,
           there is no explicit feedback channel from the client, so we
           can only estimate the network rate during periods when the TCP
           queue is full.  At these times, the holding queue will be
           non-empty for an extended period of time.  We estimate the
           network rate during these periods as follows.  When a holding
           element cannot be transmitted due to the TCP queue being too
           full, we set that element's `interval_start_time' member to
           the current time (otherwise, it is left equal to -1) and we
           set the element's `interval_bytes' member equal to the sum of
           its `reply_bytes' and `chunk_bytes' members.  From this point
           until the holding queue is finally emptied, we arrange for each
           element to be assigned the same `interval_start_time' and
           accumulate the total number of bytes transmitted from the
           interval start time in each element's `interval_bytes' member.  In
           this way, when an element is finally transmitted, having a
           non-negative `interval_start_time', the network rate can be
           estimated by dividing `interval_bytes' by `interval_start_time'.
           We apply a recursive filter to such network rate observations.
           In between such observations (when the TCP queue is not overflowing)
           we progressively increase our estimates of the network rate so
           as to encourage more and more data to be pushed into the holding
           queue, so that TCP overflow has a chance of occurring.
           [//]
           For auxiliary TCP channels, we use `interval_start_time' and
           `interval_bytes' to estimate the queueing delay, D, and
           transmission rate, R.  To understand how this works, consider the
           analogy of a leaky bucket which is filled with data in a sporadic
           manner but leaks (transmits) this data in a comaratively continuous
           manner at rate R.  Let QP denote an element on the transmission
           queue.  Let QP_T denote the time at which the element is pushed
           into the bucket (i.e., `transmit_time') and let QP_A denote the
           time at which the element's acknowledgement comes back from the
           client.  Finally, let QP_F denote the fullness of the leaky
           bucket right after QP is pushed in.  It follows that we should
           have QP_A - QP_T = D + QP_F / R.  The problem for channel
           state estimation lies in estimating QP_F.  We could use
           `window_bytes' as an estimate for QP_F, but this works well only if
           the entire burst of chunks to transmit are dumped onto the queue
           almost instantaneously, so that all unacknowledged bytes (this is
           the meaning of `window_bytes') are sitting in the bucket and no
           significant transmission occurs until after all chunks in the
           transmission burst have been pushed in (thereafter, we have to
           assume that no more data is pushed in until the bucket completely
           empties).
           [//]
           The policy implemented here is slightly more general.  It imposes
           the "instantaneous transmission" assumption only on the set of
           chunks pushed into the bucket from the start of the burst up until
           the point at which the XH element is pushed in, where XH denotes
           the `transmitted_head' element at the time when `QP' is pushed in.
           In this case, the total number of bytes which leak out of the
           bucket from the time XH_T until the time QP's bytes have all
           leaked out can be estimated by adding the `window_bytes' member
           of element XH to the number of bytes in all elements after XH up
           to and including QP.  This is the value of the `interval_bytes'
           member of the element QP.  The time taken for these bytes to all
           leak out and for the acknowledgement to come back is QP_A - XH_T.
           Accordingly, we estimate: QP_A - XH_T = D + `interval_bytes' / R.
           This method is the same as the first if XH actually contains the
           first chunk in the transmission burst.  The `interval_start_time'
           member holds the value of XH_T.

  /* Notes:
        The list of transmitted data chunks headed by `transmitted_head' is

        The temporary holding queue has the same order.  Chunks are pushed
     onto the end of the queue and moved from the start of the queue onto the
     end of the transmission queue.
        Once a chunk has been acknowledged, it is moved onto the completed
     list from which it will be removed by subsequent calls to
     `retrieve_completed_chunks'.  For auxiliary channels, it can happen that
     EOR-only chunks are sent in advance from an element which is still on
     the holding queue, before the element has a chance to enter the
     transmitted list.  If acknowledgements arrive before the element
     enters the transmitted list, they are accumulated in the
     `num_unprocessed_eor_acks' member.
        For an HTTP-only channel, all transmitted chunks are considered to
     be acknowledged immediately.  With this interpretation, most of the
     fields defined by this structure may be assigned meaningful values
     for a single primary channel or for an auxiliary TCP channel.

  /* Notes:
       Requests which arrive on a primary channel go through the following
     stages:
     1) The request is associated with a JPIP channel (CID) by setting the
        `request_cid' member to non-NULL and filling in the `request_qid'
        and `request_preemptive' members.  At the end of this stage,
        `request_cid' is non-NULL and `request_processed' is false.
     2) The JPIP channel (CID) becomes available to handle the request; this
        may depend on the `request_qid' value along with whether or not there
        are other primary channels which, for one reason or another, refer
        to the same CID.  Once the channel is available, the request is
        processed.  This means, in particular, that the request is parsed
        for a window of interest and related parameters, any cache model
        manipulation commands are processed and reflected to the server's
        cache model, and `cclose' commands are used to mark the relevant
        `kds_cid' records for closure after the request in progress
        completes (or would be preempted).  At the end of this stage,
        `request_cid' is non-NULL, `request_processed' is true but
        `reply_generated' is false.  If the request cannot be handled
        properly, a suitable error reply is generated immediately during
        this phase and the request is popped from the head of the queue,
        restoring `request_cid' to NULL and `request_processed' to false.
        Otherwise, we move on to the next stage.  In either case, the
        request is popped from the head of the `pending_requests' queue.
     3) The request is either pre-empted, or used to generate chunks of
        data in one or more epochs.  In either case, an HTTP 200 or 202
        response code must be generated, the `reply_generated' member
        becomes true.  If the JPIP channel uses an auxiliary return channel
        (HTTP-TCP), the `request_cid' member is reset to NULL (and
        `request_processed' and `reply_generated' are also reset to
        false), while possibly leaving the relevant `kds_cid::is_active'
        member true.
     4) For HTTP-only JPIP channels, the `request_cid' member is left
        non-NULL after stage 3, with `reply_generated' true until the
        relevant JPIP channel (as identified by the `request_cid' member) is
        finished responding to the request.  During this time, the relevant
        `kds_cid::is_active' flag remains true and `kds_cid::primary' points
        back to this channel.  Only once the response process for that
        CID is complete or preempted, leaving `kds_cid::is_active' false,
        does the `request_cid' member get reset to NULL and the
        `reply_generated' flag (and the other stage flags) is reset to
        false. */

      /* Here is an explanation of some of the less obvious parameters:
           `max_sources' is the maximum number of source files that can be
         accessed at any given time.
           `max_threads' is the maximum number of source threads which
         can be launched to handle client requests.  In practice, each
         stateless request requires a source thread and each stateful session
         requires a source thread.
           `max_cids_per_client' is the maximum number of stateful channel
         ID's which can be allocated to any given client (i.e., by any
         source thread).  In most cases, only one channel-ID will be used
         for stateful communication, but multiple channel-ID's are now
         supported by the "kdu_server" application.
           `max_chunk_bytes' constrains the size of data chunks used to
         deliver JPIP messages to the client.  These are the chunks used for
         chunked transfer in the HTTP-only transport mode, while they are the
         chunks on which flow control is built in the HTTP-TCP transport
         mode.
           `ignore_relevance_info' forces the server to use a naive (uniform)
         policy for allocating JPEG2000 packets to the transmission queue,
         rather than considering the relevance of different precincts to the
         request being processed.  You might use this if you doubt the
         reliability of any log-slope information in the codestreams being
         served (it is mostly for experimental purposes).
           `phld_threshold' determines the granularity with which JP2/JPX
         metadata boxes are replaced by placeholder boxes, for incremental
         transfer.
           If `password' is NULL, no external administration access will be
         allowed.
           If `caseless_targets' is true, the file system is assumed to be
         case insensitive and all filenames are converted to lowercase before
         passing them to `kd_source' -- moreover, when checking for sources
         which are already open (and hence can potentially be shared),
         a caseless comparison is performed.

         explanation is a valid HTTP status line starting with the status

         message; no new-line character should be used, and the message

         Apart from this, the source thread created in this case behaves in
         exactly the same way as if `jpip_channel_type' were "http".  The only
         two channel type strings currently recognized are "http" and
