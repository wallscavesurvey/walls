Description:
   Defines services for deriving important properties of DWT kernels from
the relevant identifier.  The implementation of the `kdu_kernels' class may
easily be extended to any odd-length symmetric DWT kernels without affecting
the way in which the derived information is accessed and interpreted by the
rest of the system.

		 is not guaranteed to exhibit any particular symmetry properties.
		 [//]
		 For non-symmetric filters, [-H,H] is only an upper bound
		 to the support of the wavelet kernel, since some of the extreme

		 `support_max' arguments (see below).
	   [RETURNS]
		 An array whose entries run from n=-H to n=+H, where H is the value
		 returned via `half_length'.  Index n=0 corresponds to the "central"
		 tap of the filter's impulse response.  Note carefully, that the
		 impulse responses are defined with respect to a slightly
		 different downsampling/upsampling convention than the one you
		 might be used to.  Specifically, the downsampling operation
		 associated with the high-pass subband retains the odd-indexed
		 samples, while the downsampling operation associated with the
		 low-pass subband retains the even-indexed subbands.  Similarly,
		 the upsampling operation associated with the high-pass subband
		 places the subband samples at location m into the odd
		 location, 2*m+1, while the upsampling operation associated with
		 the high-pass subband places the subband samples at location m
		 into the even location, 2*m.
		 [//]
		 The returned array contains a true impulse response.  If
		 analysis is to be implemented as a weighted moving average (i.e.,
		 as an inner product), you will need to reverse the corresponding
		 impulse responses to recover the weights.  Of course, this is
		 only important if the filters do not have the odd-length
		 symmetric property (i.e., if `is_symmetric' returns false).
	   [ARG: which]
		 Indicates which impulse response is required (analysis or
		 synthesis, low- or high- pass).  Valid values are
		 `KDU_ANALYSIS_LOW', `KDU_ANALYSIS_HIGH', `KDU_SYNTHESIS_LOW' and
		 `KDU_SYNTHESIS_HIGH'.
	   [ARG: half_length]
		 Used to return the value of the parameter H, such that the
		 relevant impulse response runs from -H to +H.  If the impulse
		 response does not have odd length, at least one trailing
		 coefficient must be 0.  The exact region of support may be
		 learned by supplying non-NULL `support_min' and `support_max'
		 arguments.
	   [ARG: support_min]
		 If non-NULL, this argument is used to return the actual lower
		 bound of the filter impulse response's region of support.
		 Specifically, it is used to return the value I (typically, but
		 not necessarily less than 0) such that the support is
		 [I,J].  Note that this region is contained within [-H,H] where
		 H is the value returned via `half_length'.
	   [ARG: support_max]
		 If non-NULL, this argument is used to return the actual upper
		 bound of the filter impulse response's region of support.
		 Specifically, it is used to return the value J (typically, but
		 not necessarily greater than 0) such that the support is [I,J].

		 Computes the BIBO (Bounded-Input-Bounded-Output) analysis gain

		 immediate follows those initial low-pass stages and extra low- or
		 high-pass stages.  Thus, the BIBO gain calculations for the first
		 stage in a dyadic DWT are obtained by setting

		 substantial memory resources.  For a discussion of these
