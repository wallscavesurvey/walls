	  Instances of this structure represent a single line.  If the line
   will eventually be subjected to horizontal decomposition, it is
   separated into two cosets, corresponding to the even- and odd-indexed
   samples.  During subband analysis, it is more efficient to perform
   this separation into cosets right away, before the vertical filtering
   which precedes the horizontal transformation itself.  Similarly,
   during subband synthesis, it is preferable to leave the lines
   produced by horizontal synthesis in this de-interleaved form, until
   after vertical synthesis.
	  If no horizontal transform step is to be used, only the first
   (even) coset is actually used.  To facilitate this, the `pre_create'
   function is supplied with the width of each of the two cosets
   separately.
	  The `neg_extent' and `pos_extent' arguments represent the range
   of indices which should be supported on each coset buffer.  In particular,
   each coset's buffer should support access with indices from
   -`neg_extent' to +`pos_extent', where `pos_extent' >= `even_width'
   and `pos_extent' >= `odd_width'. */

/* Notes:
	 This object maintains a queue of lines, which form the basis for
   incremental processing of vertical lifting steps.  There are exactly
   N+1 such queues, where N is the number of lifting steps.  The
   arrangement of input queues and lifting steps is illustrated below
   for the case of 4 lifting steps, so as to facilitate conceptualization:

	  ----------------> Q0     -----------> Q2      ---------->
					  /   \    |          /   \     |
				STEP0      STEP1     STEP2      STEP3
			   /    |           \   /    |           \
	  ----> Q(-1)   ------------> Q1     ------------> Q3 ---->

   The queues are labeled Q(-1) through Q(N-1), where even-indexed queues
   hold even-indexed image lines and odd-indexed queues hold odd-indexed
   image lines.  The `queue_index' member thus takes on values from -1 to
   N-1.  Lifting step k takes a weighted combination of lines from
   queue Qk and adds the result into a line from queue Q(k-1), pushing
   the result onto the tail of queue Q(k+1).
	  All line locations are expressed as absolute indices in the
   coordinate system of the node in the DWT tree which is being transformed.
   The `y_min' and `y_max' members identify the inclusive lower and
   upper bounds of line positions which belong to the entire
   tile-component at this DWT node.  Only even or odd locations
   within this range can actually be found within the queue, depending
   on whether `queue_idx' is even or odd.
	  `head_idx' member identifies the location of the first line currently
   managed by the queue -- it must have the same parity as `queue_idx'.
   The last line in the queue has location `head_idx'+2*(`num_lines'-1).
	  The `source_pos' member of Q(k) holds the location of the first line
   which will be required by STEP(k) when it next produces a
   result.  The `update_pos' member of Q(k) holds the location of the next
   line to be updated by STEP(k+1).  Lines from the head of the queue
   are automatically recycled so as to ensure that one of these two
   members is always equal to `head_idx'.
	  The one exception to the above recycling principle is that no line
   whose location equals or exceeds `recycling_lim' will be automatically
   recycled.  This condition is required to implement the symmetric
   boundary extension property for certain transform kernels, since
   symmetric extension can cause the need for later access to a line
   which would otherwise have been recycled already.
	  Before concluding, it is worth describing how the queues and lifting
   steps interact during synthesis.  This is shown in the diagram below.

	  <---------------- Q0 <--       -------<-- Q2 <--       -----<--
					  /      |     /         /       |    /
				STEP0        STEP1      STEP2        STEP3
				|    \            \     |    \            \
	  <---- Q(-1)      --------<-- Q1 <--      --------<-- Q3 ---<--

/* Notes:
	 If `step_idx' is even, this lifting step updates odd-indexed (high-pass)
   samples, based on even-indexed input samples.  If `step_idx' is odd, it
   updates even-indexed (low-pass) samples, based on odd-indexed input
   samples.
	 The `support_min' and `support_length' members identify the values of
   Ns and Ls such that the lifting step implements
   X_s[2k+1-p]=TRUNC(sum_{Ns<=n<Ls+Ns} Cs[n]*X_{s-1}[2k+p+2n]).  If the
   step is to be implemented using floating point arithmetic, the `TRUNC'
   operator does nothing and Cs[Ns+n] = `coeffs'[n].  If the step is to be
   implemented using integer arithmetic, Cs[Ns+n] = `icoeffs'[n]/2^downshift
   and TRUNC(x) = floor(x + `rounding_offset' / 2^downshift).
	 The `extend' member identifies the amount by which the source sequence
   must be extended to the left and to the right in order to avoid treating
   boundaries specially during horizontal lifting.  This depends on both
   the lifting step kernel's region of support (`support_min' and
   `support_length') and the parity of the first and last samples on each
   horizontal line.  Although the left and right extensions are often
   different, it is much more convenient to just keep the maximum of the
   two values.
	 The `add_shorts_first' member is true if the lifting implementation for
   16-bit samples adds pairs of input samples together, creating a 16-bit
   quantity prior to multiplication.  In this case, the sample normalization
   processes must also ensure that the 16-bit sum will not overflow. */
