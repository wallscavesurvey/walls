Description:
   Defines interfaces for the low-level binary symbol operations associated
with the MQ coder.  Includes, interfaces to support the arithetic coder bypass
mode as well.  Also includes macros which may be used as substitutes for the
coding functions.  Both the macros and the functions achieve the same
result, although the macro implementation is more carefully tuned for speed,
while the function implementation is somewhat more dydactic.

/* Notes:
	  This structure manages the state of the probability estimation state
   machine for a single coding context.  The representation is redundant,
   of course, since all that is required is the vaue of `Sigma', in the
   range 0 through 46, and the value of the MPS, `s' (0 or 1).  However,
   this expanded representation avoids unnecessary de-referencing steps
   by the MP encoder and so can significantly increase throughput.
	  The `transition' pointer holds the address of the entry in
   `mq_encoder::transition_table' which corresponds to this element.  There
   are 92 entries in the transition table, whose indices have the form
   `idx'=2*`Sigma'+s.  If renormalization occurs while encoding an MPS,
   the state is updated according to state=state.transition->mps; if
   renormalization occurs while encoding an LPS, the state is updated
   according to state=state.transition->lps.  The transition table is
   carefully constructed to ensure that all information is mapped correctly
   by this simple operation.
	  The trick of keeping the MPS identity in the most significant bit
   (i.e., the sign bit) of the `mps_p_bar' member, allows the encoder to
   be implemented with a most common symbol path having only one comparison
   and very few other operations. */

			the test for renormalization appears first; this helps because conditional
			exchange can occur only during renormalization.  Beyond the implementation
			tricks suggested in Section 17.1.1, we are able to combine the tests
			for an MPS symbol and a renormalization event into a single test by
			using a quantity which we shall call `lps_p_bar'.  The most significant
			bit of this 32-bit word is 1 if the symbol being coded is an LPS.  The
			15 LSB's hold the normalized MPS probability, (`p_bar' in the book).
			This trick relies upon the fact that A-p_bar must be a strictly positive
			quantity at all times, since A >= 2^15 and p_bar < 2^15 are both
			guaranteed.
			   To minimize the number of variables which are required, storage for
			`lps_p_bar' is shared with the incoming symbol.  The user should take
			careful note that the value of the symbol variable has no well-defined
			value upon return from the function. This may cause problems if the
			caller intends to re-use the symbol value.
