-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: SOURCE STRUCTURE
---------------------------
Source and header files are organized logically in directories which
suggest their function.  It is suggested that you retain this structure.
Broadly speaking, the code is organized into "coresys", "apps" and "managed"
directories.

  -- "coresys" contains code which is shared by most applications and may
be used to build a static or dynamically linked library.  Use the
make files (Linux, Unix, Solaris or MAC), the xcode project files (MAC) or
the .NET build environments (Windows) found in this directory
to build the core system first.  Typically, you use these to build the
core DLL "kdu_v62R.dll" (and debug version "kdu_v62D.dll"), the Unix
shared library "libkdu_v62R.so", or the MAC OSX dynamic library
"libkdu_v61R.dylib" (and debug version "libkdu_v62D.dylib").

  -- "apps" code includes both the source files which are specific to
individual applications, as well as quite a few more generic objects
which are shared by multiple applications, but are not required by
all (and hence are not considered core).  Again, use the make files, xcode
project files, or the .NET build environments found in this directory
to build the various demo applications, after first building the core system.
These applications are all linked against the core DLL or shared library
described above.  The "kdu_hyperdoc" application plays an important
role in automatically generating the API documentation (found in the
"documentation" directory) AND in building all source and header files
for the "managed" directory.  This tool is built both under "apps"
and "managed", for convenience.

  -- The "managed" directory exists to provide a convenient set of
managed interfaces to the entire Kakadu framework.  This includes
a complete set of native interface bindings for Java applications,
and a corresponding set of managed interfaces for use with Microsoft's
C# and Visual Basic languages (amongst others).  It also includes a
unified collection of header files in "managed/all_includes".  These
are copied from other places by "kdu_hyperdoc", so as to provide
you with convenient access to all public classes and functions.  You can
use these header files with your C++ applications.

   As before, use the make files (Unix/Linux/MAC), the xcode project files
(MAC), or the .NET build environments (Windows) found in
the "managed" directory to build the various native interface bindings
("kdu_jni" for Java and "kdu_mni" for C# and Visual Basic).  These build
environments also create an auxiliary DLL, "kdu_a62R.dll" (debug version
"kdu_a62D.dll") or shared library "libkdu_a62R.so" ("libkdu_a62R.dylib" and
"libkdu_a62D.dylib" on the MAC), which contains the implementation of all
the generic API classes and functions found in the "apps" directory.
   By linking your C++ applications against this DLL/shared library, together
with the core system DLL/shared library, you should not need to directly
include any of the source files found in the "apps" or "coresys" directories.
The "kdu_a61R.dll" dynamic library is also imported by "kdu_jni.dll" and
"kdu_mni.dll" to implement Java, C# and Visual Basic interfaces on Windows
platforms.  Similarly, "libkdu_a62R.dylib" imports "libkdu_v62R.dylib" on
the MAC.

   Kakadu's automatic documentation builder, "kdu_hyperdoc", is used to
fill out the HTML documentation in the "documentation" directory, as well
as building all C++ source and header files in the "managed" directory.
This tool draws from the extensive comments kept in the public header
files (both those in "coresys" and those in the "apps" directories),
using consistent conventions in those comments.

   To use the "kdu_hyperdoc" utility, you must first compile it, using the
make files, xcode projects, or the .NET build environments found in
either the "apps" or the "managed" directory -- the actual source code lives
under "apps" but is built from both places for convenience.  These build
environments all also execute the tool to build all the relevant documentation
and interfaces.  However, if you wish to run the tool manually, you can use
the commands found in the "hyperdoc.bat_saved" or "hyperdoc_windows.bat_saved"
files -- for Windows systems, remove the "_renamed" suffix and execute.
The only difference between "hyperdoc.bat" and "hyperdoc_windows.bat" is that
the latter includes the few additional objects which exist only on Windows
platforms and also builds the interfaces for .NET languages C# and Visual
Basic.  Note, however, that you may need to add the command-line argument
"-old_managed_syntax" to the command in "hyperdoc_windows.bat_renamed" if
you want to build interfaces for .NET languages which will compile under
Visual Studio 2003 -- the syntax changed subtantially in Visual Studio 2005
as a result of an effort to standardize the Managed Extensions to C++.

The various build environments, expect the following directory structure.

 java     <distribution>    bin   bin_x86   lib_x86   bin_x64   lib_x64
 |        |
 kdu_jni  coresys  apps  managed documentation language make bin lib

Here, <distribution> represents the directory within which these
instructions reside -- e.g., "v6_2".  The various makefiles write their
library and executable outputs to the "<distribution>/bin" and
"<distribution>/lib" directories.  The .NET build environments write
their 32-bit output to the "bin_x86" and "lib_x86" directories, while the
results from 64-bit builds are written to the "bin_x64" and "lib_x64"
directories.  The xcode project files write their
output to the "bin" directory at the same level as the "distribution"
directory.

   When executed using the makefiles, xcode project files or .NET build
environments in "apps", or using the commands in "hyperdoc.bat" or
"hyperdoc_windows.bat" commands, the "kdu_hyperdoc" tool writes Java class
files to the "java/kdu_jni" directory, which is outside the "<distribution>"
directory you received with your license.  If any of these directories do not
exist, they will be created automatically, but some conditions associated with
the creation of these directories might be reported as though they were errors
in some build environments (depending on how the build environment interprets
outputs from the scripts it runs).

   Kakadu also comes with a tool named "kdu_text_extractor" which
may be used to populate the "language" directory in the above structure
with original (english) versions of all the text used in error and
warning messages.  The various build environments compile and execute
this tool automatically.  You can make your own instances of these
language files, containing versions of the text translated into different
languages.  To internationalize your application, all you have to do is
to compile the Kakadu source with "KDU_CUSTOM_TEXT" defined, and then
include the relevant language files into the application as-is (no need
to explicitly call any functions).  You can, optionally, create separate
DLL's or shared libraries to hold the language files produced for each
language, and have your application load the relevant DLL or shared
library dynamically, based on internationalization settings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: BUILD ENVIRONMENTS FOR NATIVE CODE
---------------------------------------------
Four build environments are provided for your convenience:

  * Microsoft .NET
    -- Note that the libraries and executables are placed in directories
       which sit immediately outside the Kakadu directory, as explained above.
    -- The workspace files "coresys/coresys_2005.sln" and
       "coresys/coresys_2008.sln" may be used to build
       release and debug versions of the Kakadu core system DLL.  Be sure
       to build this first.  You will note that these workspaces
       can be used to build both 32-bit and 64-bit DLL's.
    -- The workspace files "apps/apps_2005.sln" and "apps/apps_2008.sln" may
       be used to build the example applications, linking them against
       the core system DLL.  These workspace files also build the
       "kdu_hyperdoc" and "kdu_text_extractor" tools and run them to fill
       out the contents of the "documentation" and "language" directories,
       as well as deriving code for the "managed" directory.  Be sure to
       build the core system first.  As for the core system, the Visual
       workspaces can be used to build both 32-bit and 64-bit
       DLL's, except for the "kdu_hyperdoc" and "kdu_text_extractor" tools
       for which only 32-bit executables are built.  This avoids the
       confusion which might otherwise be caused by building and executing
       64-bit versions of the tools on 32-bit platforms.
    -- The workspace files "managed/kdu_managed_2005.sln" and
       "managed/kdu_managed_2008.sln" may be used to build the
       managed interfaces to Java, C# and Visual Basic, as well as the
       C# example applications.  After you have built "kdu_jni.dll", you can
       build the Java examples using the standard publically available "javac"
       compiler from Sun Microsystems.  The managed workspaces are configured
       to build only 32-bit binaries, for maximum compatibility, although
       it would be reasonable to add a 64-bit build configuration for the
       "kdu_aux" project.
    -- Build the release configurations for speed, since the debug
       configurations include a lot of consistency checking code.
    -- If you create your own build environment, be sure to define the
       symbol, KDU_PENTIUM_MSVC or KDU_X86_INTRINSICS, to incorporate MMX,
       SSExx and other Pentium processor optimizations.  You should note
       that the `KDU_NO_SSSE3' macro may need to be defined in compilation
       environments where "tmmintrin.h" is not available (enables support
       for SSSE3 intrinsics).
    -- If the C++ pre-processor encounters difficulties including the file
       "jni.h" or "md.h" when compiling "kdu_jni.cpp" in the "managed"
       directory, the problem is almost certainly that you need to
       define the environment variable "JAVA_HOME" to hold the path of
       the Java SDK installation on your platform, so that
       "%JAVA_HOME%\include" is the root path for JNI include files.  If you
       have not installed the Java SDK, download it from Sun Microsystems,
       or else just don't build "kdu_jni.dll".  If you have installed the
       Java SDK and JAVA_HOME is not defined, go to
       "Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables"
       and define it.

  * XCODE
    -- Starting from Kakadu version 6.1, we recommend that you use the supplied
       xcode project files to build Kakadu under MAC OSX, rather than running
       the makefiles directly in a BSD shell, as was done in previous versions.
       The xcode project files provided in the "coresys", "apps" and "managed"
       directories create both debug and release code.  Moreover, the release
       versions of the dynamic libraries and binaries are built as universal
       binaries to support PowerPC and Intel processors.  The dynamic libraries
       support 32-bit G4/G5 processors, 32-bit Intel and 64-bit Intel modes.
       The demo executables are build to run in 32-bit mode on G4/G5
       processors and 64-bit mode on Intel processors.  The JNI library needs
       to support 32-bit G4/G5 and Intel flavours, since the JVM is usually
       a 32-bit app.
    -- All you need to do is open the relevant project file with xcode, select
       the "Build All" target, then click on the "build" icon.  Build either
       the "Debug" versions, the "Release" versions or both (the relevant
       executables and libraries all have distinct names, so debug and release
       versions can co-exist).  If at first you obtain link errors in building
       the "apps", this is almost certainly caused by a small bug in xcode;
       the problem is readily fixed by changing to debug mode, building
       everything, then changing back to release mode and building everything
       (or vice-versa).
    -- The XCODE project files come ready to build against the OSX 10.5 SDK,
       and are compatible with XCODE 3.0 and up.

  * Makefiles
    -- Unix style Makefiles are provided in the "make", "coresys/make",
       "apps/make" and "managed/make" directories.  You can use the makefiles
       in the top-level "make" directory to build everything -- these just
       invoke the more specific makefiles in the "coresys", "apps" and
       "managed" directories.  If you do not use the top-level makefiles, be
       sure to build in the following order: "coresys" then "apps" then
       "managed" (actually, you can omit "apps" if you like).
    -- Error and warning free compilation should occur using any recent
       release of the GCC compiler.
    -- As with the .NET build environments, you will find that the "managed"
       makefiles rely upon the environment variable "JAVA_HOME" to locate
       the standard JNI include files in the Java SDK.  If you wish to build
       "libkdu_jni.so" ("libkdu_jni.jnilib" for MAC builds), you should
       first make sure that you have the Java SDK installed (if necessary,
       download it from Sun Microsystems).  In many cases, installing the
       Java SDK from a suitable RPM source will cause the "JAVA_HOME"
       environment variable to be set up for you.  If not, define (and export)
       it to your profile (e.g., your ".bash_profile" script) to hold the
       absolute path of the active Java SDK installation so that
       "$JAVA_HOME/include" is the root path for JNI include files.
    -- If your platform does not support multi-threading (i.e., it does not
       support the POSIX "pthreads" interface), you should
       define the symbol "KDU_NO_THREADS" when compiling.  You may need to
       do this if the attempt to link against the pthreads library
       ("-lpthreads" in the "apps/make" makefiles) does not work.  You
       can still compile and test applications which use Kakadu's
       multi-threading environment (`kdu_thread_entity' and
       `kdu_thread_entity') facilities, but `kdu_thread_entity::add_thread'
       will never add extra threads to the environment.
    -- To get 64-bit addressing of compressed files (e.g., when compressing
       or expanding huge images), make sure you define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64,
       when invoking GCC.  You may also need to define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE.
       See "Makefile-Linux-x86-32-gcc" for an example.  For more information on
       how Kakadu handles very large files, offsets and other potentially huge
       quantities, take a look at the "kdu_elementary.h" header file, as well
       as "kdu_file_io.h".
    -- 32- and 64-bit compilation for Intel and AMD Linux platforms under gcc
       has been tested.  For these, use "Makefile-Linux-x86-32-gcc" and
       "Makefile-Linux-x86-64-gcc", respectively.
    -- 32- and 64-bit compilation for Solaris platforms under gcc has been
       tested.  For these, use "Makefile-Solaris-gcc".  To get 64-bit
       compilation, use "-mcpu=ultrasparc3", as suggested by the comments.
    -- Compilation for the PowerPC G5 processor, with Altivec SIMD
       optimizations has been tested by third parties.  For these, use
       "Makefile-MAC-PPC-gcc".  To build for the G4 processor,
       uncomment line 8 of "coresys/make/Makefile-MAC-PPC-gcc" which
       contains the switch "-mtune=G4".
    -- To compile for Intel MAC platforms, use the "Makefile-MAC-x86-32-gcc"
       and "Makefile-MAC-x86-64-gcc" make files.  These have been fully tested.
    -- When compiling for Intel-based targets, you may need to define
       the symbol "KDU_NO_SSSE3" if your build environment does not offer
       "tmmintrin.h".  This will become readily apparent if the compiler
       complains about instructions like "_mm_alignr_epi8".  Recent versions
       of gcc should not have such problems.
    -- 32- and 64-bit compilation under the SunPro compiler has been
       tested by a third party.  The relevant makefiles are also included
       for convenience, although not specifically supported.
    -- By and large the makefiles generate executables which dynamically
       link to the core system library.  To enable Unix/Linux systems
       to find this library, you will need to define the environment
       variable "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" to point to the relevant sub-directory of
       your Kakadu distribution's "lib" directory, or else move its
       contents to a location which is on the dynamic load path.  For MAC
       systems, the relevant environment variable is "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH".
    -- The "kdu_show" and "kdu_macshow" applications cannot be built using
       these make files.  You can build all applications for the MAC apart
       from "kdu_macshow", using the makefiles.  To build all applications
       for the MAC, including "kdu_macshow", you should use the xcode
       project files. 

To facilitate construction on Unix, MAC and Win32/Win64 platforms, all source
files (and the Makefiles) employ the Unix line breaking convention (i.e.,
no ctrl-M characters at the end of lines).  This should not cause any
problems for Win32/Win64 based compilers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: BUILDING JAVA, C# AND VISUAL BASIC INTERFACES
--------------------------------------------------------
There are two components in a JNI (Java Native Interface) implementation:
1) the Java classes which expose the relevant interfaces to Java applications;
and 2) the C++ implementation of the Java native functions.  Both components
may be constructed automatically using the "kdu_hyperdoc" utility.  To see
how this is done, you may read the usage statements produced by "kdu_hyperdoc"
or see how the utility is invoked from "apps/documentation/hyperdoc.bat"
or "apps/documentation/hyperdoc_windows.bat", or in any of the make files,
xcode project files or VC6/.NET build environments in the "apps" directory.

Note that you can omit the "-o <html directory>" arguments from the
"kdu_hyperdoc" command line if you do not want to build HTML documentation
at the same time as the Java interfaces.  You can also exercise some
control over the classes for which Java interfaces are built by
carefully selecting the header files supplied to "kdu_hyperdoc".  For
precise control, however, use the "-bind" argument, which can be
used to specify a minimal set of classes, global functions or even
class member functions, for which you want to generate language bindings.
Regardless of whether you use the "-bind" argument or not, the only
classes for which bindings can be created are those whose declaration
contains one of the strings, "[BIND: reference]", "[BIND: interface]" or
"[BIND: copy]".  These constructs are explained more carefully in the
"java-and-managed-interfaces.pdf" document, which also suggests how you
can use the utility to automatically build Java and other language
interfaces for your own C++ objects.

Once you have built the Java class declarations and JNI implementation
source files, you need to compile both.  For this, you will need to have
installed a recent JDK distribution from SUN Microsystems.  The Java classes
can be compiled by issuing the command "javac *.java" within the
"java/kdu_jni" directory (see Section 1).

To compile the JNI source and header files created by "kdu_hyperdoc",
go to the "managed" directory and use the supplied makefiles in
"managed/make" or the xcode project file "managed.xcodeproj", or the VC6
or .NET workspace files "kdu_managed.dsw", "kdu_managed_2003.sln" or
"kdu_managed_2005.sln".  Some build environments include a reference
to an assumed location for the standard JNI include files (e.g., "jni.h")
supplied by SUN Microsystems, which is obtained by expanding the environment
variable "JAVA_HOME".  As noted above in the description of the various build
environments, you may need to define this environment variable yourself
if it was not defined when you installed the Java SDK.

The final steps to configure your JNI interfaces are:
a) Ensure that the "libkdu_jni.so" shared library (Unix/Linux),
   "libkdu_jni.jnilib" shared library (MAC OSX) or "kdu_jni.dll" DLL
   (Windows), as appropriate, is included in the load path -- this is
   defined by the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on Unix systems, by
   the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on MAC systems, and by the
   PATH variable on Windows systems.
b) Ensure that the "java" directory (see directory structure in Section 1)
   is included in the "CLASSPATH" environment variable (Windows, Unix and
   MAC operating systems).

You may find it convenient to archive the native interface classes into a
single JAR file, but this is not necessary.

On Windows platforms, you can also build a complete set of interfaces
for use with the C# and Visual Basic programming languages.  In fact,
the "managed/kdu_managed_2005.sln" and "managed/kdu_managed_2008.sln"
.NET workspaces build interfaces for all of these languages, including Java,
and also build a couple of C# demonstration applications, which exactly
parallel the Java demonstration applications -- you will notice that things
look even more natural in C# than they do in Java.  The C# and Visual
Basic support is achieved through a single interface DLL, "kdu_mni.dll",
which is built using Microsoft's Managed Extensions to C++.  To gain full
access to the Kakadu interfaces from C#, just add a reference to this
DLL (or to the "kdu_mni" project) from your C# project and also
import the "kdu_constants.cs" file from the "managed/kdu_mni" directory.
The process is the same from Visual Basic.  Actually, apart from the
fact that a "kdu_constants" file is not generated by "kdu_hyperdoc"
for other languages, all of the same interface bindings should be
available from any of Microsoft's managed languages, which share the
same common runtime environment.

It is worth noting that the "managed/kdu_managed_2005.sln" and
"managed/kdu_managed_2008.sln" workspaces actually build three DLL's,
"kdu_jni.dll" (for Java), "kdu_mni.dll" (for C# and Visual Basic) and
"kdu_a62R.dll" ("kdu_a62D.dll" in debug mode).  This
last DLL is shared by both "kdu_jni.dll" and "kdu_mni.dll" so that
you can more efficiently construct systems which use multiple
languages simultaneously.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: INTERNATIONALIZATION
-------------------------------
To create applications with internationalized text, the following
procedure may be used:
1) Compile the Kakadu core system and all relevant application components
   with the symbol KDU_CUSTOM_TEXT defined -- this symbol is not defined
   by default in the build environments described above.
2) Compile the "kdu_text_extractor" tool and use it to populate the
   "language" directory with language files.  These are platform
   independent C++ source files.  You can build a single language file
   by specifying all of the Kakadu (or your own) source files via the
   "-i" switch.  However, we recommend that you invoke the
   "kdu_text_extractor" tool in the same way as is done in the
   standard build environments -- take a look at any of the "apps/make"
   makefiles, the post build project settings in the MSVC or .NET
   "apps" workspace, or the post build script in "apps.xcodeproj".
3) Copy the language source files produced using the
   "kdu_text_extractor" tool into new versions, with names which
   identify the language you want.  So, for example, you might
   copy "coresys_english.cpp" into "coresys_italian.cpp" or
   "coresys_chinese.cpp".  Edit the new language file, translating all
   text strings of interest into the target language.  For languages
   with rich alphabets, such as Chinese, you may need to create Unicode
   translations and register the text using the Unicode version of
   `kdu_customize_text', rather than the ASCII version, which is invoked
   by the original language files created by "kdu_text_extractor".
   You will also need to implement the Unicode version of
   `put_text' in the derived version of `kdu_message' that your
   application uses to render text.  Alternatively, you might use
   UTF8-encoded text and ensure that your implementation of
   `kdu_message::put_text' interprets its strings as UTF-8, rather than
   ASCII.
4) Include the relevant language files into your application (compiling
   and linking them in is enough).  Alternatively, compile each set
   of language files into a separate language-specific DLL or shared
   library, to be loaded dynamically by your application, depending on
   language settings.

Note: you may wonder whether or not your translation efforts will be
wasted if something changes in a new version of Kakadu.  However,
a quick review of the `kdu_error', `kdu_warning' and `kdu_customize_text'
functions in "kdu_messaging.h" should put your fears to rest.  Text
registration is based upon the uniqueness of context/id pairs, which
are provided in the `kdu_error' or `kdu_warning' constructor and are
also recorded in the language files.  If new calls to `kdu_error'
or `kdu_warning' are introduced in future versions of the Kakadu toolkit,
the most you have to do is to translate this new text at your leisure.
Not doing so, just means that untranslated warnings will not
be seen by the end application, and untranslated errors will produce a
message which refers the end user to you (the vendor).  If pre-existing
error/warning messages are changed in Kakadu, they will be assigned
new ID values -- all text registered against the old context/id values
will be useless, but harmless.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: LIST OF ALL COMPILATION DIRECTIVES
---------------------------------------------

A) Processor-specific speedups
   -- You should define at most one of the following
      * KDU_X86_INTRINSICS
           -- Includes the most generic implementation of MMX/SSE/SSE2
              instruction support for x86-family processors, including
              Intel and AMD processors.  The included speedups use
              processor intrinsics, which should compile on 32- and 64-bit
              platforms under both GCC and Microsoft's .NET compiler.
           -- There are two weaknesses to the X86_INTRINSICS implementations,
              however: a) they do not include some speedups to the block
              decoder, which yield about 10% improvement on 32-bit platforms
              but are unhelpful on 64-bit platforms; and b) GCC compilation
              with these intrinsics may require 16-byte stack alignment, which
              might not be guaranteed if the code is invoked as a DLL or
              shared library, from a separately compiled executable (e.g.,
              a Java Virtual Machine) which has less strict stack alignment.
           -- On the other hand, the X86_INTRINSICS implementations offer the
              most comprehensive support for SIMD speedups in the 32-bit
              sample precision processing path -- all SIMD offerings speed
              the processing of 16-bit precision sample data.
      * KDU_PENTIUM_GCC
           -- Provides MXX/SSE/SSE2 speedups which work for 32-bit and 64-bit
              builds under GCC.  These have been widely tested and are
              probably slightly faster than the KDU_X86_INTRINSICS code
              under 32-bit builds, since they incorporate hand-optimized
              deployment of registers.
           -- All speedups in the Kakadu core system have versions which are
              accessible using KDU_PENTIUM_GCC, with the exception of:
              a) SIMD speedups for the 32-bit precision sample processing path
                 (use KDU_X86_INTRINSICS to get these); and
              b) the block decoder speedups for X86-32 architectures (typically
                 about 10% improvement), which can be accessed only with
                 KDU_PENTIUM_MSVC.
      * KDU_PENTIUM_MSVC
           -- Provides MMX/SSE/SSE2 speedups which work for 32-bit builds
              under Microsoft Visual C++ (version 6) or .NET compilation
              environments.  With the sole exception of 32-bit precision
              colour transforms, all speedups are available with this option,
              with hand optimized register deployment.  As a result, this is
              the preferred option for 32-bit builds under the Microsoft
              development environments.  For 64-bit builds under .NET, this
              option is automatically converted into KDU_X86_INTRINSICS for
              you, so that you can get the best of both worlds.  For this
              reason, the currently recommended build configurations for
              all Windows systems should define KDU_PENTIUM_MSVC.
      * KDU_ALTIVEC_GCC
           -- Povides speedups for the "Altivec" vector processing engine on
              PowerPC (G4 and G5) processors.  Most of the speedups available
              through KDU_PENTIUM_GCC are also available for G4/G5
              processors through KDU_ALTIVEC_GCC, with the exception of:
              a) SIMD speedups for the 32-bit precision sample processing
                 path; and
              b) some code which accelerates quantization/dequantization
                 processes only on X86 processors.
      * KDU_SPARCVIS_GCC
           -- Provides speedups for the "Visual" vector processing engine on
              Ultrasparc processors.  Many of the speedups available
              through KDU_PENTIUM_GCC are also available for Sparc's
              through KDU_SPARCVIS_GCC, with the exception of:
              a) SIMD speedups for the 32-bit precision sample processing
                 path;
              b) Sample interleaving/deinterleaving between DWT transform
                 stages; and
              c) some code which accelerates quantization/dequantization
                 processes only on X86 processors.
              Note also that the Sparc vector processor is only 64 bits wide,
              unlike the G4/G5 and modern X86 processors, which offer
              128-bit processing.
      * KDU_MAC_SPEEDUPS
           -- Selects the most appropriate speedup options from the above,
              based upon the target architecture, for MAC OSX.  This simplifies
              the process of building universal binaries to support multiple
              CPU architectures.
   -- Customizations for the above:
      * KDU_NO_SSE
           -- When used with any of KDU_X86_INTRINSICS, KDU_PENTIUM_GCC,
              KDU_PENTIUM_MSVC or KDU_MAC_SPEEDUPS, this directive disables
              the use of SSE/SSE2 instructions, allowing only the plain MMX
              variants.
           -- There is no need to do this just to get things to run properly
              on older X86 processors, since the right code path is
              automatically selected at run-time based on the instructions
              supported by the processor.
           -- You can use this option to see what advantage in speed is
              offered by SSE/SSE2 instructions over plain MMX.
           -- When compiling with KDU_PENTIUM_MSVC under Microsoft Visual
              C++ (Version 6) you may need this option to eliminate the
              SSE/SSE2 code segments which are not supported by the compiler
              as originally distributed.  A better approach, however, is
              to download and install the "Visual C++ 6.0 Processor Pack",
              as suggested in Section 2.
           -- By using this switch to disable SSE/SSE2 portions of the code,
              you can safely use the KDU_X86_INTRINSICS option with GCC,
              even when the code might be invoked from an environment
              (e.g., a Java Virtual Machine) which does not offer 16-byte
              stack alignment.  This allows you to incorporate all of the
              MMX-based speedups for the `kdu_region_compositor' object
              defined in "apps/support".  To see how this is used, see the
              various makefiles in "managed/make".  For an explanation of the
              stack alignment problem with GCC processor intrinsics, see
              the discussion of KDU_X86_INTRINSICS above.
      * KDU_NO_SSSE3
           -- Similar to KDU_NO_SSE, except that it disables attempts to use
              the Intel SSSE3 instructions in build configurations which
              would otherwise attempt to use them.  You should define this
              macro if your build environment does not yet offer "tmmintrin.h".
      * KDU_NO_CPUID_TEST
           -- When used with any of KDU_X86_INTRINSICS, KDU_PENTIUM_GCC or
              KDU_PENTIUM_MSVC, this directive bypasses the static
              initialization code in "kdu_arch.cpp" which examines the CPUID
              instruction to test for the availability of MMX instructions
              as well as the more advanced SSE and SSE2 instruction sets.
              Instead, support for MMX instructions will be assumed and
              support for SSE/SSE2 instructions will be assumed on 64-bit
              platforms.  Use of this option is not recommended, but provides
              a simple fix to any problems you might possibly encounter with
              Kakadu code crashing on start-up (all such problems should by
              now have been fixed).

B) Internationalization
      * KDU_CUSTOM_TEXT
           -- Define this symbol if you intend to include all error/warning
              text via separately compiled source files or libraries, built
              from the contents of the "language" directory.  This is
              explained more thoroughly in Section 4 above.

C) LIBTIFF inclusion options for the "kdu_compress" example application
      * KDU_INCLUDE_TIFF
           -- This is only required to enable integration of the "libtiff"
              library into "kdu_compress", not to enable reading/writing of
              TIFF files per se.
           -- From v5.1, Kakadu comes with its own native TIFF directory
              read/write/edit implementation, in the form of the `kdu_tiffdir'
              class.  This object may be used to manipulate TIFF structures
              embedded in JP2/JPX boxes (e.g., GeoJP2 boxes) or to read/write
              TIFF files themselves.  As a result, the "kdu_compress" and
              "kdu_expand" demo applications now natively support reading and
              writing of TIFF files; however, since these are only
              demonstrations, they do not provide any support for reading
              compressed data samples found within TIFF files (e.g., packbits,
              LZ or JPEG compressed TIFF's).  You can, however, add support
              for reading such files to "kdu_compress", as follows: obtain the
              "libtiff" package yourself (it is publically available
              from the web) and compile and link "kdu_compress" against it,
              defining KDU_INCLUDE_TIFF.

D) DirectX inclusion options for the "kdu_vex_fast" example application
      * KDU_DX9
           -- This is required if you wish to enable the highly efficient
              real-time display demonstration code in "kdu_vex_fast".  It
              should be provided only for Win32/Win64 builds.
           -- If you have not yet installed the DirectX SDK, version 9 or
              above, you will want to remove this symbol from the
              pre-processor definitions in .NET 2005 build environments.

E) Miscellaneous
      * KDU_NO_SCHED_SUPPORT
           -- Define this on Unix systems which offer pthreads support
              do not support the "sched_..." functions encountered in
              "kdu_elementary.h".  At least older versions of solaris
              appear to be in this category, which is why this macro
              is defined in the Solaris makefiles provided.
