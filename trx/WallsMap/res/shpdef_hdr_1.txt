WallsMap Shapefile Template Ver 1.2
===================================

If selected as a template, this file will be read by WallsMap to determine
the attribute table structure of exported shapefiles.

FORMAT:

The only lines in this file read during an export begin with a period, hence
an attribute field definition would actually begin with .FLD, not FLD as
indicated in this generic description:

FLD <name> <type> <fld_length>[.<decimals>] [<< <src_name>] [;<comment>]

Note that optional parts of the definition are enclosed in square brackets.

<name> is the field's name in the shapefile's DBF component. A legal name can
be up to 10 characters long and have no embedded spaces. It should consist
only of uppercase letters, digits, and underscores. Some field names beginning
with an underscore (e.g., _DATUM) are given special treatment by WallsMap as
described below.

<type> can be either N (numeric), L (logical: Y/N or T/F), D (date:
yyyymmdd), C (fixed-length text), or M (variable-length text, or memo).

The required <fld_length> is the field's total length in characters. For
numeric fields this number can have an appended period and decimal count,
such as 10.2. The maximum length of type C fields is 254. Logical fields,
date fields, and memo fields are forced to have lengths 1, 8, and 10,
respectively.

An optional string "<<" followed by <src_name> specifies that the value for
attribute <name> is to be derived from a field named <src_name> in the source
shapefile. When no source field is specified, the field is initialized to
blanks. If <src_name> is enclosed in square brackets ([..]), a type C field
will be initialized with the bracketed character string.

SPECIAL CASES:

The following field subsets, whichever you specify, are automatically
maintained by WallsMap assuming it has sufficient information. If you choose
to use them, only the field names are required; the sizes and types are
forced to have the values indicated.

FLD	_LATITUDE	N	12.7	; Degrees latitude
FLD	_LONGITUDE	N	12.7	; Degrees longitude

FLD	_EASTING	N	12.2	; UTM easting (meters)
FLD	_NORTHING	N	12.2	; UTM northing (meters)
FLD	_ZONE		C	3		; UTM Zone (e.g., 14N)

FLD	_DATUM		C	5		; Datum (e.g., NAD83)

The two fields below are also maintained automatically during updates.
They store a 19-char timestamp followed by a 30-char editor's name, such
as "2008-09-20 19:20:30 D.Smith." During an export, the contents of these
fields are always copied unchanged if they exist in the source shapefile.

FLD	_CREATED	C	50	; Created date/time/name
FLD	_UPDATED	C	50	; Updated date/time/name

ABOUT MEMO FIELDS:

When type M (memo) fields are specified, a .DBT file containing the text will
be created as part of the shapefile set. WallsMap supports the display and
editing of memo fields, but typical behavior for a GIS viewer is to tolerate
their presence in the table while ignoring the .DBT file. Note that memo
fields and C fields are compatible, meaning that one can be the field created
with the other being the field copied from in the source shapefile.
