** FILE:   	pack.c	- packs (encodes) quantized data stream
** CREATED:	1998
** AUTHOR: 	SNS
** PURPOSE:
**
**	Packs (encode) a stream of data.
**	There is one visible routines for packing entire blocks:
**
**		int	pack_data(UINT8 **p_packed,	UINT32 *packed_length,
**					  UINT8  *p_raw,	UINT32 raw_length, UINT8 symbol_size_hint);
**
**	NOTE: This code is set up to encode blocks, but can easily be modified to handle
**	streaming input (not blocked).  This is actually faster than blocking input (which
**	is handle for random access but not much else).
**	If you do stream input, then you should just use the range encoders, and restart
**	them every 2^23 bytes or so.
**
**	Back routine returns non-zero if there was an error, in which case
**	no memory will have been allocated (so don't free it).
**	Raw_length MUST be a multiple of symbol_size_hint
**
**	pack_data() packs the raw data, which is raw_length (in bytes)
**	in length.
**	[06] if *p_packed == NULL, it returns a pointer to a newly allocated array of data p_packed,
**	which is packed_length in bytes, which must be freed by the caller once usage
**	is complete. If *p_packed is NOT null, it is assumed that the caller has pre-allocated
**	the memory required.
**  The caller can supply symbol_size_hint as a hint to the encoder
**	as to the natural length of each symbol in the raw data (for example sizeof(UINT16)),
**	and must be between 1 and 16 inclusive.
**	The returned data will be packed by one of a variety of techniques (the packer
**	selects the best method).  In the worst case, the returned data will never be
**	longer than raw_length+1 in size (which is no packing could be done - one byte is
**	added to indicate the packing technique used). You must pass at least one byte to
**	be packed.
**	It is recommended that compression size is kept under 64K for efficient packing
**
**	NOTES:
**	(1)	You can only compress 2^32 bytes of data in a single hit. If you need to
**		compress more than this, you will need to call the pack_data() routine
**		multiple times.
**
**	(2)	The pack_data() routine tries multiple encoding/compression techniques
**		to decide which is the best for the data. Thus, it is fairly slow to
**		compress, but decompress is fast.
**
**	Note that in all cases:
**	(1)	Lengths are handed to these routines in bytes, not symbol lengths
**
**	ENCODING NOTES:
**	1) This uses the range encoding technique, with permission, from Michael Schindler
**
**
** EDITS:
** [01] sns	05oct98	Split out from quantize.c
** [02] sns	15oct98 Moved range & qsmodel code into this source file for optimization speed
** [03] sns	07mar99	No longer doing dec_normalize in done_decoding, as not need in read from memory instead of file
** [04] sns 07mar99 Converted dec_normalize to a macro as in-line optimization is not picking it up
** [05] sns 16Mar99 added "COMPRESS" compile definition to compile either pack or unpack logic
** [06] sns 19May99 unpack_data() can now be called with a pre-allocated memory array
** [07] sns 21May99 Adding additional signed range encoding techniques
** [08] sns 26May99 Not zero encoding if +/-1 -- now only zero encoding for true zeros
** [09] sns 02Apr99 Split unpack logic out to unpack.c
** [10] sns 03Apr99 Adding RangeZero encoding
** [11] sns 09Apr99 Adding Huffman encoding
** [12] dmm 14Jun99 fix overrun in worst case huffman encoding
