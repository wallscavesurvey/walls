** EDITS:
** [01] sns	09-May-99 Created file
** [02] sns 17-May-99 Cancelling reads if too many SetViews are pending
** [03] sns 17-May-99 Allows NULL entries for queued SetViews
** [04] sjc 15-May-00 NCScbmQueueIDWTCallback() called from 2 threads now
**					  - so need to do check all the time
** [05]  ny 23-Nov-00 Mac port changes
** [06] sjc 22-May-01 Removed - this is done in Read*() calls already, was causing FMR & FMW hits & crashes.
** [07] jmp 23-Jul-01 Put in fix for bug where IDWT thread can be left in a suspended state after a SetView
**					  Using an Event object instead of ThreadSuspend/Resume.
** [08] rar 10-Oct-01 Mac port changes to required to support changes above [07]
** [09] sjc 11-Aug-04 Bugfix, force another refresh callback if read not called during last one
