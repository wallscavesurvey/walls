**
** NOTES
**
**	A wavelet compressed file consists of a normal .ERS file,
**	containing map projection details and so forth, and the
**	ER Mapper Compressed Wavelet (.ECW) file, which contains
**	the following structure:
**
**	ECW Header format is:
**
**	UINT8	ERW_HEADER_ID_TAG 'e'
**	UINT8	VERSION NUMBER (1..255)
**	UINT8	blocking format (BLOCKING_LEVEL = blocking individual levels)
**	UINT8	compress format	(COMPRESS_UINT8 = rescale back to 0..255 for each band.
**							 COMPRESS_YIQ = YIQ encoding of a 3 band RGB file. Number of bands must also = 3)
**	UINT8	number of QMF levels (excluding file fake level)
**	UINT8	Number of subbands (sidebands). Currently always 4.
**	UINT32	X size of the file
**	UINT32	Y size of the file
**	UINT16	Number of bands of data (must be 1 or more)
**	UINT16	quantization scale factor
**	UINT16	X block size
**	UINT16	Y block size
**
**		Then for each level (other than the largest level, being the fake file level), the
**		following is written out:
**	UINT8		Level number
**	UINT32		x_size
**	UINT32		y_size
**	IEEE4		binsizes for each band in the file (so 1 for greyscale, 3 for RGB or YIQ)
**				(note that currently all sidebands for a band have the same binsize)
**
**		Next, the block offsets for all blocks, relative to the start of all level blocks (not relative to
**		the start of the file), are output.  As these can be a large number, they are output
**		as a compressed set. A block may contain multiple subbands. We only record the total
**		block length, as we always need all subbands.
**		Blocks are output to disk in the order of levels, so all level 0 blocks will be on disk
**		first, then level 1, and so on. The block offsets are stored in a single array, in
**		the same way. Because we want to read and write this array, for all levels, as a single
**		operation to/from disk, because we want to optimize compression by writing the entire
**		group, only one array for all QMF levels is allocated, and each QMF points into part of
**		that single array. The array is attached to the top level (which points to the first
**		entries), and is freed at that level.
**		NOTE WELL: We need to know the size of each block, which is the different between block X
**		and block X+1 offsets. Therefor, we have to write one more block offset than actually present,
**		which contains the offset to the end of the file (e.g. the file length). This could also
**		be used as a file consistency check. Eitherway, it must be there. So the block offset
**		buffers are allocated with +1 for this reason.
**
**		The length of the compressed block is written first.
**		Blocks are written with the offset to each subband other than the first,
*		then the ENCODED DATA for each subband, so the data stream is:
**	UINT32	Length of the compressed block
**	UINT8	encoding_style
**	<compressed stream of UINT64 block_offsets>
**
**		Then, the blocks of sideband data are output.
**		A block is defined as containing (level : MAX_SIDEBAND ? MAX_SIDEBAND-1) sidebands (e.g. 3 for
**		levels greater than zero, and 4 for the level 0).
**
**		As noted above, each block contains multiple sidebands. Each sideband is encoded in the
**		ENCODED DATA format as follows.
**		Blocks are written with the offset to each subband other than the first,
**		then the ENCODED DATA for each subband, so the data stream is:
**	UINT32	Offset to HL_SUBBAND	ONLY OUTPUT IF LEVEL 0 (as there will be a LL SUBBAND output)
**	UINT32	Offset to HH_SUBBAND
**		Then for each subband (4 for 1st level, 3 for all others):
**	UINT8	encoding_style
**	<compressed stream of UINT64 block_offsets>
**
**	After this, other routines write each compressed QMF level out to file.

**	QMF sideband images are sub-blocked, so that sub-sections of sideband images
**	can be retrieved without having to read the entire sideband image.
**	So a block will be BLOCK_SIZE_X * BLOCK_SIZE_Y symbols in size.
**	The total must be less than or equal to 64K result (to ensure that encoders
**	have a fixed maximum to encode).  Smaller blocks means faster load time over
**	internet (for NCS technology), but more inefficient compression and overhead.
**	The best size is 1024(x)x64(y), which is fast, good compression, and small size.
**	Note that the compressor can compress an entire file without blocking; this
**	is a convenience definition related to decompression of images, it is not
**	essential for operation of the compressor.
**
**	The X block size is typically greater than the Y block size. This is because
**	once a block is found, it is fast to read it, and because increasing Y block
**	size increases the amount of memory required to store blocks prior to encoding
**	Both numbers must be even numbers.
**
**  [07] Note: The ENCODE_RUN_ZERO decoder currently limits block size in X to 2^15
**	in size - which should never be a problem as this is a huge value for a single
**	block, but is something  to be aware of. The RUN_ZERO unpack code is easily enhanced for larger
**	block sizes, at a slight expense in performance.
**
**	[10] Block size can now be set during compression via command line. This is the default.
